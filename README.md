Atomic CSS
==========

A template for getting started with Atomic CSS

The idea behind Atomic CSS is that the web is made up of atoms, which combine to make molecules, organisms, and eventually templates and pages.

Use this directory structure to get started on an Atomic CSS project with SASS.

To get the SASS to compile, type the following into the Terminal from the css/ folder:

    sass style.scss:style.css

To get SASS to automatically watch for changes, this is the syntax:

    sass --watch style.scss:style.css

To get SASS to automatically compress your css, do this:

    sass --watch style.scss:style.css --style compressed
